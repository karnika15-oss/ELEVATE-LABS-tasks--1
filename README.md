Loaded the Netflix dataset using pandas. Handled missing values: Filled director and cast with 'Unknown'. Filled country and rating with the most frequent value (mode). Converted date_added to datetime and filled missing dates with a default value (01-01-2000). Filled duration with 'Unknown'. Removed duplicate rows using .drop_duplicates(). Standardized text values like country names using string cleaning. Converted date formats (date_added) to datetime type. Renamed column headers to lowercase and replaced spaces with underscores. Checked and fixed data types, ensuring release_year is numeric.
